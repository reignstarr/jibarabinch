Hyperlinks can be styled differently when you hover over them and when they have already been visited. The code below sets the link to be blue when not visited, dark grey when :hovered and mediumseagreen when :visited
The :hover and :visited are called pseudo selectors because they select a state of an element. */

  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
}
