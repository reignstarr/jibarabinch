# Web Site Project

Create a web site about a topic of your choosing that is at least four pages. One example is a “choose your own adventure” style story. [Here is an example of that style](https://prpinkas.github.io/myOwnAdventure/index.html). You could also make a portfolio to display the projects from our class or just things that you’ve made or are interested in.

## Requirements

* Site Map
* 4 pages
* Base Elements
* Required Content Elements
* External Stylesheet (linked to all HTML pages)

### Site Map

You need to have a site map

### Minimum Page Count

You site must have at least 4 HTML pages. You can have more than that.

### Base Elements
The base elements are required to set up your page. These are not content elements. **All** your pages should include the required base elements

* doctype
* html
* head
* title
* body

Remember that you can get all of these through the Emmet shortcut:

* Create a new .html file
* Type ! then press the tab key

### Required Content Elements

Each HTML page should have at least one each of the following elements – you can use more: 

* h1 (page heading)
* p (paragraph)
* img (image)
* a(link).
    * Always include an option to go back to the home page (index.html) on every page.

### Proper Image use and Credits

Make sure you only use Creative Commons or Public Domain images and that you attribute them directly on the page. If you use your own images, **credit yourself**.

### CSS

Once you’ve completed and tested all the HTML, style your code with CSS. Use at least the following properties - you can use more:

* color
* font-size
* font-family
* background-color
* Extra Credit:
  * margin and/or padding
  * width

There is a file named **example.css** in the .lesson folder. This has examples of CSS that you can copy and paste and then modify to fit your project.
